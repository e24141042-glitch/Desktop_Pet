# DesktopPet

A simple WPF application that creates an interactive desktop pet.

## Features
- Displays an animated GIF as a desktop pet.
- Customizable animations (idle, sleep, tired, walk).

## Technologies Used
- C#
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- WpfAnimatedGif (for GIF playback)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio (or a compatible C# IDE)
- .NET Framework (version specified in `DesktopPet.csproj`)

### Building and Running
1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open the `DesktopPet.csproj` file in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution.
4. Run the application (usually by pressing F5 in Visual Studio).

## Customization
- **Images:** Replace the `.gif` files in the `Images/` folder with your own animated GIFs. Ensure they have the same names (`idle.gif`, `sleep.gif`, `tired.gif`, `walk.gif`) or update the code to reference new filenames.
- **Behavior:** Modify the `MainWindow.xaml.cs` file to change the pet's behavior, animations, and interactions.
